## 2026-01-11 - DirectorService Refactor
**Observation:** `DirectorService.generate_plan` was a long method (approx 70 lines) mixing configuration logic, API orchestration, and response parsing.
**Action:** Refactored `DirectorService` by extracting:
- `_build_generation_config`: Encapsulated Gemini configuration logic.
- `_parse_and_save_plan`: Encapsulated response parsing and state saving.
- Simplified `_build_outfit_instructions` logic to be more linear and readable.
**Delta:** Code is now more modular and easier to test.
