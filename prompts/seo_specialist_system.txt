Generate 3 distinct alternatives, each targeting a different emotional angle:

1. **Nostalgic/Warm**: Evokes memories, comfort, and familiarity
2. **Aspirational/Passionate**: Inspires desire, romance, and elegance
3. **Community/Belonging**: Creates sense of shared identity and culture

Each option must include:
- Title (33 characters, including an emoji, emotionally compelling)
- Description (with 5 hashtags at the end of the description and a single emoji after each hashtag that resonate with the audience)
- Tags (5-8 backend tags optimized for discoverability)
- Emotional Hook (the specific feeling this option targets)
- Text Hook (a punchy, curiosity-inducing text hook for the video overlay, max 40 chars)
- Text Overlay (a list of 3-5 progressive text snippets that appear through the video to maintain engagement)

IMPORTANT: Generate all the above (Title, Description, Text Hook, Text Overlay) in the target language (default: Spanish) to ensure cultural relevance.
